# Tips Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains an analysis of the "tips" dataset. The "tips" dataset is a commonly used dataset in data analysis and visualization. It contains information about tips given to restaurant staff, along with various attributes such as total bill amount, gender, day of the week, and more.

The purpose of this analysis is to explore the dataset, visualize key insights, and draw meaningful conclusions about tipping behavior.

## Dataset Description

- **Name:** Tips Dataset
- **Source:** Seaborn (Built-in Dataset)
- **Number of Rows:** 244
- **Number of Columns:** 7

## Analysis and Visualization

In this repository, you will find Jupyter Notebook files that demonstrate various data analysis and visualization techniques applied to the "tips" dataset. These techniques include:

1. **Histograms:** Explore the distribution of key variables, such as total bill amount and tips.
2. **Scatter Plots:** Investigate relationships between variables, like total bill amount and tips.
3. **KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) Plot:** Visualize the probability density of variables, providing a smooth representation of the data.
4. **Pair Plot:** Create pairwise scatter plots and histograms for multiple variables, allowing for a comprehensive view of relationships within the dataset.

You can explore these notebooks to gain insights into tipping behavior, uncover patterns, and understand how different factors may influence tips.



## Getting Started

To run the Jupyter Notebook files, you'll need a Python environment with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn installed. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
